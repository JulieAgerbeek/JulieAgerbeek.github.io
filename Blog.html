								<p> During the second project of my first year studying CMGT, I ran into the issue of perfectionism.
									I've always been a perfectionist but usually I would have the time to figure it out and make something
									to my liking. <br> However, the project had two week deadline and I wanted to do so much more than we actually
									had time for. This resulted in me really needing to tell myself that enough is enough and
									I needed to learn how to manage better. <a href="Blog1.html" >Read more</a>

									<p> Rarely will it happen that one gets along with everyone in a (project) group. I'd had struggles in groups before, but never quite like this project.
										In last term's project, I struggled with communicating with one specific team member. They almost never showed up and refused to listen to any comments.
										All my normal ways of approaching their lack of presence or motivation, didn't seem to be able get trough to them. It was during this project, that I
										really got a masterclass in communicating with different people.

									<p> The first time I had a real problem with time managment since starting CMGT in August 2021, was towards the 
										hand-in of the 3D modeling assignment. I've been 3D modeling in Blender for a few years by now and expected
										to be able to spend more time on the other assignements and then make a model just in time. I had underestimated
										the time it would take me to get used to Maya. <a href="Blog3.html" >Read more</a>

									<p> As a designer, my role is to lead and guide the team to a hopefully good conclusion of the project. 
										In previous project, I had unfortunately struggled with inactive designers, leading me to have to often take charge
										of all designer tasks as well as some tasks for other roles. This lead to the fact that when I was finally paired with
										another dedicated and capable designer as well as fast and reliable group members from other roles, that I struggled
										with letting go of certain tasks and trusting the team to be able to figure tasks out themselves.
