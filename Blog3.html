												<p> The first time I had a real problem with time managment since starting CMGT in August 2021, was towards the 
                                                    hand-in of the 3D modeling assignment. I've been 3D modeling in Blender for a few years by now and expected
                                                    to be able to spend more time on the other assignements and then make a model just in time. I had underestimated
                                                    the time it would take me to get used to Maya and this combined with internet issues lead to me failing the first hand-in.
                                                    I felt very frustrated with this as I am a tutor (who helps students plan) as a sidejob and I pride myself on my
                                                    planning abilities. It showed me that university is a different beast from what I am used to and I shouldn't underestimate
                                                    even the things that I feel should be easy.

													<p> Since that particular incident, I've taken a long look again at how I plan. I had been getting lax in adding
                                                        events to my physical and online agenda as well as planning too many activities on a day.
                                                        I started working on writing down more again in my physical and digital agenda, as well as making sure I check them
                                                        at least once every (two) day(s). Doing that, really helps make sure that I know at all times when deadlines are,
                                                        how much time I've laid out for them, but also when I have social events. Having it all written down, gives me a clearer head,
                                                        since I don't have to mentally think about my planning.
                                                        It also helped me give myself more space for school. What I've been trying to do, is to spread out the workload more.
                                                        I work very nicely on a short time frame but it's less healthy. Spreading out the workload, allows me more freetime and a better
                                                        understanding of what I'm working on.<br> <br>The main benefit is that since I start quite ahead of time now usually, I know very quickly
                                                        if a project or subject requires more attention or I need help. I have more free time and since re-adjusting my planning,
                                                        I've had no such incidents as with the 3D modeling course.
