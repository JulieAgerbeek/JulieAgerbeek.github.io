											<p> Swamp Unleashed is a 3D co-op endless runner. The game is split screen and controlled by a small arcade box. It's made for two players
												so there is one joystick and two buttons for each player. The game itself is a randomly generated endless runner where the players have to
												avoid obstacles and run through different biomes.<br><br> There are three biomes in total, and each biome has it's own look and obstacles. 
												There is the surface web, the deep web, and the dark web. The 3D models in the background change depending on the biome, and represent the theme of the biome.

												<h3>What I did</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
											My tasks in this project were mainly focused on planning, organizing, assisting where possible, and creating the
											controller, and it's box. 
											After the initial setup was done, I made the 3D model of a snake to assists the artists and retouch my 3D modeling skills, and after that
											I made the controller and it's box. I fully soldered the arduino to the proper buttons and joysticks, and I made sure the box was solid enough to
											support mashing without breaking. <br>I made sure the box was easy to open and close, so that the arduino could be easily removed or repairs could be done if needed.
											I also made the code to run the controls of the game through the arduino. I ensured that the code was easy to read and understand, and I made sure it was easy to change 
											to suit any additions.
											I then worked a little bit in Unity. I set up lighting to highlight assets more, and I implemented the audio as well as writing a
											script to loop the music across all scenes seamlessly.
											</p>

												<h3>More details on the project</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
											Below you can find images of both the controller and other work I did for the project, such as the snake model and the Start Screen UI. I implemented
											the created UI assets into Unity, and I made the model for the snake. Artists from my team created the UI and textured the snake.
