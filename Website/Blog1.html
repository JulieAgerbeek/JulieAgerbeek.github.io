												<section>
												<p> During the second project of my first year studying CMGT, I ran into the issue of perfectionism.
                                                    I've always been a perfectionist but in high school I would normally have the time to figure it out and make something
                                                    to my liking. However, the project had two week deadline and I wanted to do so much more than we actually
                                                    had time for. This resulted in me really needing to tell myself that enough is enough sometimes. I realised this
                                                    after our first brainstorming session and when I was getting started on a task and asset list. We were using
                                                    MoSCoW and I realised that a lot which I had put in 'Should have' were actually not mandatory for the project to be succesful.
                                                    If we continued down the current path, I would be pushing my team to do much more than we had the time and capacity for,
                                                    which is something that I wanted to avoid.

													<p> After realising my issue, I sat down with the team again and we discussed how we could make sure that all tasks and
                                                        assets of the project that were necessary to get a good grade were in the Must Have, Should Have, and Could Have of the MoSCoW.
                                                        During our discussion, I made sure that the whole team agreed and knew in detail what would be made for the project as a Must Have,
                                                        and Should Have, and potentially Could Have. This way we could focus on finishing first what we needed and then if we had the time,
                                                        we could look into things on the Could Have list. It was during this project that I also made my first in-depth task and asset list.
                                                        The benefit of having those really worked out, is that it's easier for the team to know what to do, but also what is the standard,
                                                        since it was pre-determined with the team beforehand.

													<p> All in all, I think perfectionism has its benefits and downsides. The benefit for me makes itself known in a drive to always do better,
                                                        learn, and develop myself as much as I can. The downsides for me personally, as mentioned in this blog, are the slippery slopes to wanting
                                                        to do too much and overworking myself (and my team). Since starting to use the MoSCoW method, a Minimal Viable Product, and a detailed task 
                                                        and asset list, it has become much easier for me to limit myself in both a team and personal setting, but while still performing to the high
                                                        standard I have for myself and teams I'm in.
