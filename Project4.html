												<h3>The making of:</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												For this project, my team was tasked with creating a point and click game in GXP engine, an engine developed by my university. 
												We started by seeing how ambitious we could be with the team we had and quickly decided that we would need a designer to help draw and potentially code.
												I ended up taking this role on. It was a very new but fun experience. We realised as we were working it was a lot more work than we'd thought, but all roles worked well together and 
												we were able to finish the product in time, and it was fully working.
											</p>

												<h3>My role - In this project my main focus was:</h3>
											</header>
											<div class="bullet">
												<ul>
												<li>Narrative design: storyboard, narrative, player journey</li>
												<li>The logistics of the puzzles: create fun but possible puzzles</li>
												<li>Coding: helped scene transitions, helped asset implementation</li>
												<li>Drawing and colouring guard NPC and a few scenes</li>
												</ul>
											</div>
											<p>
												I got to code the transition between scenes as our engineer was very busy with the coding of the puzzles and pick up system. This gave me some good
												feel and experience for coding scenes. I've since also coded scene transition in Unity.
												I drew the guard and I was very happy with how he turned out as I don't necessarily consider myself an artistical designer.
												The guard in the left picture below is drawn and coloured by me. The scene in the right picture below was coloured by me.
