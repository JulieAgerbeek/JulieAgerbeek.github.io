												Slope Madness is an Arcade style game where the player can step onto a snowboard like controller.
												The goal is to get as far down the snowy mountain as they can, while avoiding fallen wintersporters,
												trees, and rocks.

													For Slope Madness, the team had to think of a creative way to create a unique arcade experience.
													As a fanatic snowboarder myself, the topic of a snowboard based arcade game seemed very interesting.
													Immediately from the start, I made sure the engineer who was in charge of building the snowboard (the controller)
													, had the space to work on the controller and helped him where necessary. This allowed us to have a functional
													controller in time for the end of the project.

												<h3>My Role</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												During this project, I was in charge of all the necessary document and planning. Each morning I would make sure to
												have the team check together what everyone was doing, what still needed to be done and push the things that should
												be focused on to the front. Everyone had a short list of tasks that had priorty for them to complete as soon as possible
												as well as a longer role specific task list for each role (engineers, artists, designers).
											</p>

												<h3>The making of</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												At the start of the project, one of our engineers who didn't have too much coding skills, mentioned he would be able to
												build a snowboard like input device/controller. Seeing this as a better point for his skillset, I asked him to start on this
												as soon as he could to at first prove he would be able to do it. Then when he was able to quickly show us this, the team gave
												him the okay to build the final board. I helped with the more practical sides of building the board, making the asset and task list,
												designing the look of the game (where the horizon should be), and mostly giving input on art and code made by the team.
